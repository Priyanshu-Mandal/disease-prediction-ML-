    <h2> AGE (Adults)</h2>
    <p>Age group of 65+ Years</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <p>Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to medication side effects and drug interactions, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication for headaches.</p>
    <p>Aspirin, acetaminophen, and certain types of prescription medications may be appropriate for some elderly individuals, but other medications like ibuprofen and naproxen should be used with caution due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.</p>
    <p>It's important to follow the recommended dosage and avoid overusing headache medication to prevent rebound headaches.</p>
<br>
<BR>
<p>It is important to note that these medications should only be used as directed and under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Dosage and frequency of medication can vary based on age, weight, and other health factors.</p>
