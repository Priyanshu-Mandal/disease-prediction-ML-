    <h1>COUGH MEDICATION INFORMATION</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>AGE (Children)</h2>
    <p>Age group of 2-11 Years Old</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <p>Over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are not recommended for children under the age of 6 due to potential side effects. However, some cough medicines may be recommended for children over the age of 6. Examples include Delsym, Robitussin, and Mucinex.</p>
    <br>
<p>It's important to note that coughing is often a symptom of an underlying condition such as a cold, flu, or allergies, and treating the underlying condition may be more effective than just treating the cough. Additionally, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider if a cough persists for more than a few days or is accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty breathing or chest pain.</p>

              <h1 style="color: red;">POINTS TO REMEMBER</h1>
<br>
              <h2>Here are some points to remember about cough:</h2>
    <h2>1. Cough is a reflex action that helps to clear the throat and airways of mucus, irritants, and foreign particles.</h2>
    <h2>2. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, allergies, smoking, air pollution, and respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD.</h2>
    <h2>3. Cough can be acute (lasting less than three weeks) or chronic (lasting more than eight weeks).</h2>
    <h2>4. Acute cough is usually self-limiting and does not require medical intervention, but chronic cough may require evaluation by a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause.</h2>
    <h2>5. The quality of cough can provide clues about its cause. For example, a dry, hacking cough may indicate a viral infection, while a wet, productive cough may indicate a bacterial infection.</h2>
    <h2>6. Treatment for cough depends on its underlying cause. For example, cough caused by a bacterial infection may require antibiotics, while cough caused by asthma may require bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory medications.</h2>
    <h2>7. Home remedies, such as drinking plenty of fluids, using a humidifier, and avoiding irritants like smoke and dust, can also help to relieve cough.</h2>
    <h2>8. In some cases, cough may be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition, such as lung cancer. If cough persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, it is important to seek medical attention.</h2>
