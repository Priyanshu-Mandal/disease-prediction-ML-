              <h1 style="color:red;">POINTS TO REMEMBER</h1>
    <h2>1. A fever is a common sign of illness, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.</h2>
        <h2>2. In fact, fevers seem to play a key role in fighting infections.</h2>
            <h2>3. So should you treat a fever or let the fever run its course? Here's help making the call.</h2>
    <h2>4. These recommendations are for people who are generally healthy — for instance, those who are not immunocompromised or taking chemotherapy drugs and haven't recently had surgery.</h2>
              <h2>5. The values listed in the table below are for temperatures taken with rectal and oral thermometers.</h2>
              <h2>6.These thermometers provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature.</h2>
            <h2>7.Other types of thermometers, such as ear (tympanic membrane) or forehead (temporal artery) thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.</h2>
