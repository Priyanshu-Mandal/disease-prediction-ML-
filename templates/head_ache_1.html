    <h2> AGE (Children)</h2>
    <p>Age group of under 12 Years</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <p>Avoid using aspirin for children under the age of 12 due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition.</p>
    <p>Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are commonly used for headaches in children, but it's important to follow the recommended dosage based on the child's age and weight.</p>
    <p>If the child's headache persists or worsens, it's important to seek medical attention.</p>
    <p>For children under the age of 12, it's best to consult a pediatrician before administering any medication for headaches. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are usually safe for children, but the dosage needs to be appropriate for their age and weight.</p>
<br><br>
<p>It is important to note that these medications should only be used as directed and under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Dosage and frequency of medication can vary based on age, weight, and other health factors.</p>
